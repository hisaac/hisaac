# Hi there, I'm Isaac Halvorson ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile. It's good to have you here.

## About Me

I'm a macOS, iOS, and web developer living in [Lauderdale, MN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauderdale%2C_Minnesota), a tiny suburb of [Minneapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis). In my free time, I blog at my homepage [hisaac.net](https://hisaac.net), [listen to as much music as possible](https://www.last.fm/user/hisaac), tinker with code, and spend time with my wife and son. You can see more of what I'm doing at my [/now](https://hisaac.net/now.html) page.

My interests include science fiction, music, technology, and open source software. Ask me my thoughts on [Benjamin Sisko](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Benjamin_Sisko), [Londo Mollari](http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Londo_Mollari), [Aphex Twin](https://song.link/album/s/6oRuinkJdTge4hpTuClEF8), or [Neil Young](https://song.link/album/s/3w5Hok05AFjCLy269xXM7e) sometime. I've got many thoughts to share.

I currently work as a macOS developer for [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com), a software company based out of Minneapolis.
